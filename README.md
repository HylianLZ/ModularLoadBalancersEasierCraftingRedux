# LoadBalancersEasierCrafting
This Mod will lower the building cost of the Modular Load Balancers Mod and also lower the milestone to Tier 1 - Logistics. 

The building cost is equal to the vanilla Splitter/Mergers.

The Filter blocks will cost the same as the vanilla smart splitter

The Programmable blocks will cost the same as the vanilla programmable splitter.


I didn't change anything from the original except update the dependencies' versions in the mod and test it to make sure it still worked.
